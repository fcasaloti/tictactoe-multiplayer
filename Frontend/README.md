# tic-tac-toe

This application was designed based on https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html which provides guidance to develop it, however this application has some improvements such the use of toggle buttons to reverse button order, highlight check square and games' winner, and inform the location of each move. Additionally, I separated all the components in different files, organized and made minor changes on CSS.
